# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview
A clean, modern personal portfolio / CV site with a "tech" feel.

# Features
- 
- Function over flair: prioritize readable structure and clear sections (About/Skills/Experience/Projects/Contact) rather than heavy animations.

- Modern Stack: Built with Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Smooth Animations: Framer Motion for elegant transitions and interactions
- Fully Responsive: Optimized for all devices and screen sizes
- SEO Optimized: Meta tags and structured data for search engines
- Security-First: Following best practices and secure coding standards 
- Zero Config Deployment: Automated GitHub Actions workflow
- Accessible: WCAG compliant design

## Colors
- Color is restrained and utilitarian. It's a neutral palette (near-black/charcoal) with gray UI elements for separation and hierarchy.
- Accent color is used sparingly (mainly on interactive bits like links / emphasis), so nothing feels loud or "branded" - more "professional/dev portfolio."
- Readability and atmosphere is priority. The colors should feel calm, minimal, and safe.

## Design
- Clear hierarchy & flow: sections are ordered logically (About → Skills → Experience → Projects → Contact) and the nav makes it easy to jump around.
- Consistency: the site uses repeated patterns (headings, cards, spacing) so it feels coherent.
- Hero area: Name should be clear. Use typedtext below the name. Add icons for linkedin, github, email. Make room for a punchy line.
